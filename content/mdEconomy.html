<h1>Economic Well-Being in Maryland</h1>

<p>In general, Maryland is a prosperous state, with the highest median income of any state. However, disparities exist. Among the counties there are huge differences, with Howard County residents earning a median income of $108, 503, and rural Somerset County having a median income of only $36,106.</p>

<p>In spite of this prosperity, there are some alarming recent trends in child poverty. The percent of children in poverty has risen steadily from 11.8% in 2009 to 13.9% in 2013. Predictably there are also more homeless children in the public schools and there has been an increase in children receiving free and reduced meals, up from 36% in 2009 to 44% in 2013.</p> 

<h1>Policy Highlight</h1>

<p>In response to increasing child poverty, Maryland initiated the Maryland Meals for Achievement program, which provides classroom breakfast to students in 360 schools. Researchers from Harvard University have evaluated the project's impact on academics and behavior. They have found that classroom breakfast has a positive impact on Maryland School Performance Program (MSPAP) scores and grades. Researchers also credit classroom breakfast with improving student attendance by about two days per school year, decreasing tardiness and behavior problems, and increasing students' attention spans.</p>
