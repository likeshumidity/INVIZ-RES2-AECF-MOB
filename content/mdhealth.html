<h3>Children's Health in Maryland</h3>

<p>For the fourth consecutive year, Maryland saw a decrease in its infant mortality rate, reaching 6.3 per 1,000 live births. Governor Martin O’Malley’s original goal of a 10% reduction in the 2007 infant mortality rate was achieved in 2009, prompting the creation of a new goal. With the reduction seen in the infant mortality rates this year, Maryland is well on its way to achieving the new goal of an additional 10% reduction of overall infant mortality and Black infant mortality by 2017.</p> 

<p>The number of births to adolescents continued to decline, with a birth rate of 22.1 per 1,000 adolescents (ages 15-19). Maryland remains significantly below the national average in this metric, as jurisdictions have developed their own plans to reduce teen pregnancies in their communities.</p>

<p>Other indicators also showed some regression, for a variety of reasons. Vaccine coverage among children ages 19 - 35 months saw a significant decline in 2012.</p> 

<p>The percent of 4th grade students who ranked below basic on the NAEP reading assessment is shrinking, going from 35% in 2005 to 23% in 2013. High school students passing the HAS test is at it’s highest rate since 2009, and the percentage of youth 16-19 who are not in school and not working dropped from 5% to 4%. </p> 

<h3>Policy Highlight</h3>

<p>IIn July 1998, HCFA approved Maryland’s CHIP plan to expand coverage to low-income children through Medicaid. The program covers children through age 18 to 200 percent of the FPL.27 In CHIP’s second year, which starts in July 1999, the state plans to require premium contributions of 1 to 2 percent of household income from families between 185 and 200 percent of the FPL. It also will require families of CHIP eligibles who are above 185 percent of the FPL to purchase employer-based dependent coverage when it is available and meets specific cost and coverage criteria.</p>

<p>Largely through increased outreach, Maryland hopes to expand coverage under CHIP to about 60,000 uninsured children, including 15,500 newly eligible children between 185 and 200 percent of the FPL or over age 14. According to one study, there are currently not enough uninsured children under 200 percent of the FPL for the state to spend down its allotment of federal CHIP funds.28 As of November 1998, the program had enrolled 31,000 children, including about 2,000 children between 185 and 200 percent of the FPL.29 This number represents a much higher share of eligibles than most other states. Program officials attribute this success to an aggressive marketing and outreach effort. Advocates claim that enrollment of nearly half of eligible children in less than six months is impossible and indicates that there are more uninsured children below 200 percent of the FPL than had been estimated.30</p>
