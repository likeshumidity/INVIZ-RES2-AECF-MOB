<h1>Family and Community in Maryland</h1>

<p>The number of births to adolescents continued to decline, with a birth rate of 22.1 per 1,000 adolescents (ages 15-19). Maryland remains significantly below the national average in this metric, as jurisdictions have developed their own plans to reduce teen pregnancies in their communities.</p>

<p>While the United States Department of Agriculture indicates that the rate of household food insecurity increased in 2012, Maryland has increased its efforts to connect low-income children to federal nutrition programs, led by the Governor’s Partnership to End Childhood Hunger. More children than ever before received a free or reduced-price school breakfast in 2012, ensuring more students can start their day prepared to learn.</p>

<h1>Policy Highlight</h1>

<p>Maryland recently passed several bills that could improve circumstances for children in the foster care system. Services were expanded to contact relatives of minors in order to support placements of children at risk with family members who are not in the child’s immediate family.  The age at which a family member can become a foster parent for a minor was also reduced form 21 years of age to 18.</p> 

<p>A pilot program was also recently expanded that helps the Department of Juvenile Services identify children in need and provide them with supportive services to reduce then number of children involved in the child welfare system who end up involved with DJS because of truancy or other minor violations.</p>
